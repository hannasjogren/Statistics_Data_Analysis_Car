This project analyzes car price data to identify key factors influencing the pricing and market trends. The analysis includes factors such as brand, model, year of manufacture, engine size, fuel type, mileage and ownership history to provide valuable insights for car dealerships and buyers.

Key Insights::
- The majority of cars are priced between $5,000 and $25,000, with a skew towards lower prices.
- There is a strong negative correlation between mileage and price, indicating that higher-mileage cars tend to be significantly cheaper.
- Fuel type affects price: Electric cars generally have higher prices, while diesel and gasoline cars are more common in the lower price range.
- Newer models tend to retain higher values, which is expected due to depreciation effects.
- Cars with fewer previous owners typically have higher resale values.

Recommendations:
1. Focus on acquiring low-mileage vehicles, as they retain value better and attract higher prices.
2. Monitor the increasing demand for electric vehicles to adapt inventory accordingly.
3. Prioritize selling newer models, as they provide better profit margins and higher customer demand.
4. Consider targeting brands and models that have historically shown strong price stability.
5. Offer detailed vehicle history reports to build trust and justify higher pricing for well-maintained cars.
